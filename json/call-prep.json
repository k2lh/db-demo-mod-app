{"dnbIndustryCode":1531,"industryName":"Warehouse Clubs & Superstores","keyBusinessChallenges":{"challenge":[{"title":"Low Margins","description":"To be profitable, companies must compensate for low margins through extremely high-volume sales. The business model for a warehouse club depends on volume, and soft sales due to slow store traffic reduce efficiency and increase operating costs. Because companies stock only a few products in each category, merchandising errors can disastrously affect sales. Companies typically carry gross margins between 8 and 12 percent, versus 25 to 35 percent for grocery and general merchandise stores. ","question":"How sensitive are the company’s profits to changes in sales volume? ","orderNumber":1},{"title":"Competition from Alternative Retailers","description":"Because warehouse clubs offer products in numerous categories, companies compete with many types of retailers. The market response to a new club can be intense, and deep discounts by competitors on key products can make warehouse clubs appear less attractive. Grocery stores and mass merchandisers offer wider selections and tend to be in more convenient locations. In addition, food retailers carry similar large sizes previously available only in warehouse clubs. Specialty retailers can provide an extremely broad selection within a product category, and typically provide much better customer service. ","question":"How does the company develop a competitive strategy that addresses different types of retailers? ","orderNumber":2},{"title":"Keeping Operating Costs Low ","description":"With thin margins, warehouse clubs depend on extremely efficient operations to keep costs low. Companies rely on direct manufacturer shipments and cross-docking facilities to reduce distribution and storage costs. At the same time, warehouse clubs rely on high volume sales and can't afford stock-outs. Companies must strike the proper balance between low inventory costs and potential lost sales. ","question":"What ongoing programs does the company have to improve operational efficiency? ","orderNumber":3}]},"keyBusinessOpportunities":{"opportunity":[{"title":"Stocking More High-End Merchandise","description":"By offering more expensive products, companies can attract affluent customers who tend to spend more. As customer demographics improved, premium brands (like Chanel and Cuisinart), which had previously avoided club distribution, started courting warehouse clubs. Costco offers diamonds with retail prices surpassing $100,000, and is the largest US seller of fine wines. While many consumers skimp on basic purchases, some are willing to spend more for high-ticket items that are discounted. ","question":"What trends has the company seen in demand for high-end merchandise? ","orderNumber":1},{"title":"Creating Fun Shopping Experience","description":"By searching out unique, hard-to-find items and pricing them low, warehouse clubs can create a “treasure hunt” experience and increase customer enthusiasm. Warehouse clubs get free advertising when loyal club members brag to friends about great deals. In addition, regular food tastings can draw crowds and make warehouse club outings a habit. While warehouse clubs may not offer a luxurious environment, companies can still provide a fun shopping experience to build a loyal customer base. ","question":"How does the company generate customer excitement? ","orderNumber":2},{"title":"Specializing in Product Segments","description":"Focusing on an important category can allow companies to better compete for a specific market, and offer a wider range of merchandise within a segment. BJ’s focuses on food, and offers smaller package sizes for important fresh foods to better compete with grocery stores. Costco specializes in high-end merchandise and attracts more affluent customers.
