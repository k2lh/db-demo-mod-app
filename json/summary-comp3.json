According to retail industry surveys, consumers' willingness to join warehouse clubs has greatly increased during the past several months.A heavily concentrated club base in the Eastern U.S. provides some distribution and marketing scale advantages. Management will prioritize club openings in existing markets over expansion into new markets in the foreseeable future.A diverse private-label offering complements BJ's branded assortment nicely. With price points 20% below their branded counterparts, private-label products could become more relevant amid a challenging consumer environment.The development of a membership database should assist the firm in identifying its most popular merchandise, fine-tuning marketing efforts, and refining its real estate strategy.","bearsSay":"BJ's carries 3,000 more products than Costco (7,300 versus 4,000) and operates locations that are 25% larger. As a result, BJ's possesses less purchasing power than Costco and turns inventory 30% slower.Given BJ's concentration in the Northeast U.S., operating results are more exposed to regional economy fluctuations than competitors with a national footprint.Food and gas price volatility could disrupt the firm's quarterly results.Despite modest improvement during 2009, BJ's membership renewal rates for both individuals and small-business customers continue to trail those of competing warehouse club operators."}}}
