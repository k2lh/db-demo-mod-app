offers investors the highest near-term cash flow visibility in the defensive sector because of its membership fee model and high-quality customer base.The loss-leader capabilities of Costco's business model should continue to drive disproportionate market share gains over the long term.In contrast to its big-box industry peers, Costco's international operations generate returns above its cost of capital.The company trades toward the higher end of the defensive sector on a P/E basis but it can grow into a more attractive multiple because of sustained, double-digit EPS growth.","bearsSay":"The stock has reached a new 52-week high and valuation multiples are above the defensive sector average, which suggests there is greater downside, rather than upside, risk.There is little room for further household penetration because Costco already has about 65 million members, so long-term sales and earnings growth forecasts are not sustainable.There is potential for the private equity firm that acquired BJ's Wholesale club to re-accelerate domestic warehouse openings, which would create a tougher competitive environment."}}}
